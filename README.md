# Image Processing with OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates various image processing techniques using OpenCV. The tasks include loading images, copying images to avoid aliasing, flipping and rotating images, cropping images, modifying specific image pixels, and drawing shapes and text on images.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-processing-opencv.git
   cd image-processing-opencv

2. Install the required packages:
   pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib

Image Processing Tasks
1. Load and Display the Baboon Image
The script loads the baboon.png image and displays it using Matplotlib.

2. Copy Images to Avoid Aliasing
The script demonstrates how to copy images to avoid aliasing and verifies the memory addresses of the copies.

3. Modify Original Image and Compare
The script modifies the original image and compares it with the copied images.

4. Flipping Images
The script flips the cat.png image vertically and horizontally using both manual and OpenCV methods.

5. Cropping an Image
The script crops the cat.png image vertically and horizontally.

6. Changing Specific Image Pixels
The script changes specific pixels in the image and compares the altered image with the original.

7. Drawing Shapes and Adding Text
The script draws a rectangle and adds text to the cat.png image.

8. Flip and Mirror the Baboon Image
The script flips the baboon.png image vertically and mirrors it horizontally.
